Review:
    This program allows network messages to be sent to a list of
    people in either FidoNet or in Internet or both.  The SysOp
    maintains a set of groups in a configuration file.  The groups
    contain information on each individual in a group consisting
    of personal names and network addresses (either FidoNet addresses
    and/or Internet addresses.)  Each group has its own unique origin
    line for outbound FidoNet messages

    FileAttaches and FileRequests may be performed on a group to
    allow for both mass mailings as well as mass file requests and
    distributions.

Files required:
    There are a few files which are required.

    MailList.CFG - The main configuration file.  This file is self-
    explanatory and should be modified to fit your needs.  There is
    nothing in the file which is unexplained or at all confusing.
    Review the comments within the file for further information on
    how to configure your mailing lists.

    MailList.ERR - This file contains error messages which are used
    by MailList.EXE.  They have been removed from the source code
    and placed into a separate file so that various languages may be
    used in the program simply by editing this file.  This file also
    allows comments to be added to it.

    MailList.EXE - This is the executable program.  To invoke the
    MailList program, simply type MAILLIST at the DOS prompt.

Nodelist and Networks:
    If you have a 'nodelist' keyword defined in the configuration file,
    you can use the special user-name of 'network' in a group to take
    The 'network' user name following a 'name' keyword is followed by the
    zone:network address.   Example:

                        name    network, 1:218

    You may have as many 'network' type name entries in a group or as many
    groups with networks defined.  At initialization, the program will
    examine the nodelist and extract all nodes for the networks you
    have configured and build a group of names and addresses based
    upon the whole network.

    Systems which are private, on hold, or marked as down will also be
    mailed to if you include an entire network into a group.

    While the program is searching for names in a network, you may hit the
    ESCape key to abort the search.  If there is another user-name with
    the symbolic name 'network' in a group, you will need to hit ESCape for
    that group as well if you wish to abort it, too.  The program will
    display the zone and network which is being accumulated so you will
    know which network scan you are aborting.

Environment Variable:
    You may elect to run MailList from the directory where the error
    message file and the configuration file are stored or you may elect
    to set an environment variable to tell MailList where to find these
    two files.  If you wish to execute MailList from any directory,
    asking the PATH to find your executable, set the MAILLIST environment
    variable to point to the directory where the MailList.CFG and
    MailList.ERR files are to be found.  As an example, in your
    AUTOEXEC.BAT file, add the following:

                set MAILLIST=C:\FD\UTILS\

    The trailing backslash isn't needed as one will be appended to the
    path if none is offered.

Running the program:
    After you run MAILLIST from the DOS prompt, the program will read
    the configuration information into memory and provide a list of the
    groups which are configured.

    After you select the group number to mail to, you will be asked for
    the name of a file which contains the message text you wish to send
    to everyone in the group.  If the file is not found, the program
    will terminate.

    After the name of the message-text file has been entered, the
    program will ask you to enter a subject for the message.

    After you have finished entering the subject for the message, MailList
    will send the message to each individual in the list.  As each
    message file is created and addressed, MailList will display the
    status update on the screen, flagging each successfully-created mail
    message wioth a * character.  The bottom of the screen will show the
    name of the FidoNet network message.

    When all messages have been sent, the program will terminate
    normally.

Error messages:
    If the configuration file has problems with it or if MailList has a
    problem, a window will open-up on the screen and a detailed error
    message will be displayed.  The program will then terminate with an
    errorlevel value so that you may work MailList into a batch file.

ErrorLevel values:
        #define No_Problem              0

    When the program terminates normally, it returns this value.

        #define Cant_Find_Config_File   10

    If the MailList.CFG file can't be found, this errorlvel value
    will be returned.  Either the current directory doesn't contain
    the MailList.CFG file or the MAILLIST environment variable is not
    pointing to the directory which has the configuration file.

        #define No_Memory               11

    MailList ran out of memory.

        #define Configuration_Bad       12

    Something in the configuration file was bad.  The error message
    which is offered before this errorlevel value is returned will
    contain detailed information on what went wrong.

        #define Cant_Create_Message     13

    If for some reason a network message file can't be created, an
    error message is offered and then the program terminates with
    this errorlevel value.

        #define Cant_Write_Message      14

    If for some reason a network message file can't be written, an
    error message is offered and then the program terminates with
    this errorlevel value.

        #define Cant_Find_Errors_File   15

    If the MailList.ERR file can't be found, this errorlvel value
    will be returned.  Either the current directory doesn't contain
    the MailList.ERR file or the MAILLIST environment variable is not
    pointing to the directory which has the error message file.

        #define Error_File_Corrupted    16

    The MailList.ERR message file is corrupted.  The error message on
    the display will indicate what the problem was.

        #define Cant_File_Attach        17

    The file for a file attach request couldn't be found or could not
    be opened because it was in use.  Check to make sure that the file
    exists and that it may be opened.

        #define Text_File_Missing       18

    The text file which was offered as the message file to send to a
    group could not be found.  Check to make sure that the file exists
    and that it may be opened.

Configuration Commands:
        group {title}

            Defines the name of the mailing list.  The 'group' keyword
            is usually followed by a 'from' line, a 'directory' line,
            an 'origin' line, and then any number of 'name' lines which
            describe the individuals in the group.

        directory {subdirectory}

            Defines the subdirectory where messages that are created
            are to be placed.

        from {SysOp Name}

            Defines the name of the individual sending the messages.
            This is usually your name.

        origin {text}

            Defines an origin line for messages sent to a group.

        name {name}, {address}
        name NETWORK, {subnet}

            Defines the name of an individual in a mailing list and the

            of address (zone:net/node.point) or it may be an Internet
            address (name@path.domain)

            If the name is replaced with the special word NETWORK then
            all systems in the subnetwork described gets mailed.

        nodelist {full path}

            Points to the FidoNet nodelist.  This is needed if there
            are any 'NETWORK' type 'name' commands defined.

            The point number of your nearest UUCP Gateway.

        immediate {yes} || {no}

            Tells MailList if you want to mark mail as IMMediate
            and DIRect.

        crash {yes} || {no}

            Tells MailList if you want to mark mail as CRASH.
