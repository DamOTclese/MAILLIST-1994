; This is the error message file for MailList.EXE version 1.001.  It
; may be edited to suit you as you wish however you must make sure
; that there are 20 error messages defined and that the description
; doesn't change significantly and that you don't renumber them.  Only
; the text should change as you see fit.
;
; The program will reformat the display to be free-flowing so you may
; describe an error message as long as you wish.  A blank line tells
; the program where a description ends.
;
; No single error message may exceed 1000 bytes in length.

0, A group name doesn't have a mailing directory defined for it!  The
   keyword 'directory' needs to be included in every group definition
   else the program won't be able to create outbound message files.
   The group which is missing this information is offered below:

1, A group name doesn't have a from name defined for it!  The keyword
   'from' needs to be included in every group definition else the
   program will not be able to place a 'from:' name into the outbound
   message file header.  The group which is missing this information
   is offered below:

2, A group name doesn't have a origin string defined for it!  There must
   be an origin line for every group defined.  The group which is
   missing this information is offered below:

3, I ran out of memory!

4, The configuration file doesn't have a group name defined before
   a directory name is defined.  The 'directory' keyword must follow
   the use of the 'group' keyword else the program will not be able to
   know what group the directory should be assigned to.

5, The configuration file has a group configured which has more
   than one mailing directory. This is not allowed.  The 'directory'
   keyword must appear only once in each group that's configured.  The
   group name where the duplicate appeated is offered below:

6, The configuration file doesn't have a group name defined before
   a from name is defined.  The 'from' keyword must follow the 'group'
   keyword else the program will not know what group the 'from' name
   should be assigned to.

7, The configuration file has a group with more than one from name
   defined.  This is not allowed.  There must only be one 'from'
   keyword for every group defined.  The group name where the duplicate
   appeared is offered below:

8, From name is too large! Must be 35 characters or less.  This limit is
   imposed by the FidoNet message protocol and can not be changed.  The
   configuration line I was trying to examine is offered below:

9, The configuration file doesn't have a group name defined before
   an origin string is defined.  The 'origin' keyword must follow the
   'group' keyword else the program will not know which group the origin
   should be assigned to.

10, The configuration file has a group with more than one origin
    lines defined for it. This is not allowed.  There may only be one
    'origin' line in the definition of a group.  The group name where
    the duplicate appeated is offered below:

11, The configuration file doesn't have a group name defined before
    a user name is defined.  The 'name' keyword must follow a 'group'
    keyword else the program will not know what group to place the name
    into.

12, Configuration file name entry doesn't have a proper format.
    I need the users name and the mailing address separated by a
    comma.  The configuration line I was trying to examine is offered
    below:

13, A name is too large! It must be 35 characters or less!  There is an
    entry with the keyword 'name' which exceeds 35 characters.  This
    limit is imposed by the FidoNet message protocol and can not be
    changed.  The configuration line I was trying to examine is
    offered below:

14, A name of a user does not appear to have a valid address. If it's
    an Internet address it needs to have at least one @ character in
    it.  If it is FidoNet, it must be zone:net/node.point.  If any of
    these address elements are missing, the program will refuse to run.
    If the name is an entire network, either the network address was not
    complete or there is no 'nodelist' defined in the configuration file.
    The configuration line I was trying to examine is offered below:

15, I am unable to run as I can't find the configuration file
    'MAILLIST.CFG' in the current directory.  This file is needed to
    define the groups in the mailing lists.  You may define the
    environment variable MAILLIST to point to the directory of where
    the configuration file is.  An example would be: set MAILLIST=C:\FD\
    The configuration file searched for is offered below:

16, I can't create the message file!  The outbound FidoNet network
    message couldn't be created.  Either the outbound network mail
    directory doesn't exist else there is not enough disk space left to
    create a new file.  The file name which couldn't be created is
    offered below:

17, I couldn't write the message file!  The outbound FidoNet network
    message couldn't be written.  The most probable problem is that the
    drive specified in a 'directory' keyword is out of disk space.  The
    file name I tried to write to is offered below:

18, The file name you have offered for a FileAttach request could not
    be located.  Please check to make sure that the file actually exists
    and that it is available for open and run the program again.  The
    file name which couldn't be found is offered below:

19, The file name you offered to send as message text to a group could
    not be found or opened.  Check to make sure that the file actually
    exists and that the file can be opened (the file may be in use.)
    The file name I tried to open is offered below:
