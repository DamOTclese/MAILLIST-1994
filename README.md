# MAILLIST-1994
1994, FidoNet/Internet Mailing Lists!  Send messages to groups of people in mailing lists you maintain in an ASCII text file. This is version 1.001 - color and greater sanity checking.  YOU MUST ASK THE SYSOP (Fredric Rice) FOR THIS PROGRAM! Code written in C++ kind of (only C syntax, actually) with make files. This was very popular for a while.
